      <h2>Game System</h2>
      <p>
        Gacha System:<br />
        Genshin Impact utilizes a gacha system for acquiring characters,
        weapons, and items.<br />
        Players spend in-game currency or real money to obtain randomized
        rewards from various banners.<br />
        The gacha system features different rates for obtaining rare, uncommon,
        and common items, with pity systems to guarantee higher-rarity drops
        after a certain number of pulls.<br />
        Players can use Primogems, Acquaint Fates, and Intertwined Fates to
        perform pulls on specific character or weapon banners.<br /><br />

        Battle System:<br />
        Genshin Impact features real-time action combat with an emphasis on
        elemental interactions and team synergy.<br />
        Players control a party of up to four characters, each with unique
        elemental abilities and combat roles.<br />
        Combat revolves around exploiting elemental reactions such as Overload,
        Superconduct, and Vaporize to deal damage and control the
        battlefield.<br />
        Dodging, blocking, and timing attacks are essential for success in
        battles against enemies and bosses.<br /><br />

        Event System:<br />
        Genshin Impact regularly introduces limited-time events offering special
        rewards, challenges, and story quests.<br />
        Events may include character trials, domain challenges, world
        exploration events, and co-op challenges.<br />
        Completing event tasks and objectives grants event-exclusive currencies
        and items that can be exchanged for valuable rewards.<br /><br />

        RNG Mechanics:<br />
        RNG (Random Number Generator) mechanics influence various aspects of
        gameplay, including loot drops, artifact stats, and gacha pulls.<br />
        Players rely on RNG for obtaining rare items, upgrading artifacts, and
        acquiring powerful characters and weapons through the gacha system.<br />
        RNG adds an element of chance and uncertainty to gameplay, requiring
        players to adapt and strategize based on random outcomes.<br /><br />

        Artifact System:<br />
        Artifacts are equipment items that enhance character stats and abilities
        in Genshin Impact.<br />
        Players obtain artifacts from defeating bosses, completing domains, and
        exploring the world.<br />
        Artifacts come in sets, with bonuses granted for equipping multiple
        pieces from the same set.<br />
        Upgrading artifacts involves enhancing their stats using artifact fodder
        and materials obtained from dismantling unwanted artifacts.<br /><br />

        Character System:<br />
        Genshin Impact features a diverse roster of characters, each with unique
        abilities, elemental affinities, and combat roles.<br />
        Characters are obtained primarily through the gacha system, with some
        obtainable through story progression, events, and the in-game shop.<br />
        Players can level up characters, upgrade their abilities, and equip
        weapons, artifacts, and accessories to enhance their stats and
        abilities.<br /><br />

        Parkour System:<br />
        Genshin Impact features a dynamic parkour system that allows players to
        traverse the open-world environment with agility and freedom.<br />
        Players can climb various surfaces, including walls, cliffs, and
        structures, by holding the designated climb button.<br />
        Certain character abilities and elemental skills may also aid in
        parkour, such as geo constructs and anemo updrafts that propel
        characters into the air.<br /><br />

        Weapon System:<br />
        Weapons in Genshin Impact come in various types, including swords, bows,
        catalysts, claymores, and polearms, each suited to different playstyles
        and character roles.<br />
        Weapons can be obtained through the gacha system, crafted using
        materials, purchased from shops, or obtained as quest rewards.<br />
        Like characters, weapons can be leveled up, refined, and enhanced using
        enhancement materials and weapon-specific upgrade materials.<br /><br />

        Exploration System:<br />
        Genshin Impact features an expansive open-world environment divided into
        seven regions, each with its own distinct landscapes, biomes, and
        landmarks.<br />
        Players can explore the world freely, discovering hidden treasures,
        puzzles, and challenges scattered throughout the landscape.<br />
        Completing exploration tasks, such as unlocking teleport waypoints and
        activating statues of the seven, provides valuable rewards and
        experience points.<br />
